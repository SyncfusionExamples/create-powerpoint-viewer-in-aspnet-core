# Syncfusion .NET PowerPoint Library
The Syncfusion [.NET PowerPoint library](https://www.syncfusion.com/document-processing/powerpoint-framework/net/powerpoint-library) (Presentation) allows you to add advanced PowerPoint presentation processing functionalities to any .NET application and does not require Microsoft PowerPoint application to be installed in the machine. It is a non-UI component that provides a full-fledged PowerPoint presentation instance model similar to the Microsoft Office COM libraries to iterate with the presentation elements explicitly and perform necessary manipulation. Take a moment to peruse the [documentation](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/getting-started), where you can find basic PowerPoint presentation processing options along with the features like create and edit [charts](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/working-with-charts), [clone](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/working-with-slide#cloning-slide) and [merge](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/working-with-slide#merging-slide) slides in presentation, create and edit [animations](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/working-with-animation#edit-existing-animation-effect) and [transistion](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/create-edit-slide-transitions-in-powerpoint-presentation-slides-cs-vb-net#modify-a-transition-effect-applied-to-a-powerpoint-slide) effects, [protect](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/security) the PowerPoint presentation, and most importantly, the [PDF](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/presentation-to-pdf) and [Image](https://help.syncfusion.com/file-formats/presentation/presentation-to-image) conversions with code examples.
